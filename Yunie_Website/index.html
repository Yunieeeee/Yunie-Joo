                        <p>The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul in South Korea and Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea,
                            is a writing system for the Korean language created by King Sejong the Great in 1443.
                            The letters for the five basic consonants reflect the shape of the speech organs used to pronounce them,
                            and they are systematically modified to indicate phonetic features. Similarly,
                            the vowel letters are systematically modified for related sounds, making Hangul a featural writing system.</p>

                    <div class="P2">
                        <p>Modern Hangul orthography uses 24 basic letters: 14 consonant letters (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ) and
                            10 vowel letters (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ). There are also 27 complex letters formed by combining the basic letters:
                             5 tense consonant letters (ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ), 11 complex consonant letters (ㄳ ㄵ ㄶ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅄ) and 11 complex vowel letters (ㅐ ㅒ ㅔ ㅖ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅢ).</p>

                        <p> Hangul was created under King Sejong during the Chosun Dynasty (1393-1910).
                           During his reign, King Sejong always deplored the fact that the common people, ignorant of the complicated Chinese characters that were being used by the educated, were not able to read and write.
                           He understood their frustration in not being able to read or to communicate their thoughts and feelings in written words. What he envisioned was a set of letters that was uniquely Korean and easily learnable,
                            rendering it accessible and usable for the common people.
                            <span class="bold"> 1446, the first Korean alphabet was proclaimed under the original name Hunmin chong-um, which literally meant "Language for the People."</span>
